**[Day 1: Java Learning Journey](/src/Day1)**

**Overview:**
Today, I focused on foundational Java concepts, including understanding the Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Virtual Machine (JVM). I also explored primitive data types, control flow statements, and loops.

**Topics Covered:**

1. **Java Basics:**
   - **JDK, JRE, and JVM**: Learned the differences and relationships between JDK, JRE, and JVM. 
   - **Primitive Data Types**: Covered different primitive data types, their sizes, ranges, and default values.

2. **Control Flow Statements:**
   - **`if-else` Statements**: Used to make decisions in the code.
   - **`switch` Statement**: Employed for multi-way branching.

3. **Loops:**
   - **`for` Loop**: Iterated over a range of values.
   - **`while` and `do-while` Loops**: Used for repeated execution of code blocks.

4. **Project Implementations:**
   - **[Guess the Number Game](src/Day1/ProjectA.java)**: A console application where the user guesses a random number.
   - **[Simple Calculator](src/Day1/ProjectC.java)**: A console application that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
   - **[Student Grade Management System](src/Day1/ProjectC.java)**: A console application to input grades, calculate the highest, lowest, and average grades.

**Key Learnings:**
- **Primitive Data Types**: Their properties and usage.
- **Control Flow**: Making decisions and branching in code.
- **Loops**: Repeating tasks and iteration.
- **Project Practice**: Implementing projects to reinforce learning and understanding of the concepts.

**[Day 2: Java Learning Journey](/src/Day2)**

**Overview:**
Today, I focused on advanced Java concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, arrays, and strings. I also worked on practical projects to solidify my understanding of these concepts.

**Topics Covered:**

1. **Inheritance:**
   - **Concept**: Allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
   - **Key Points**: Superclasses, subclasses, `super` keyword.

2. **Polymorphism:**
   - **Compile-time Polymorphism**: Method overloading.
   - **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method overriding.
   - **Key Points**: Same method names behaving differently based on the object.

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - **Concept**: Bundling of data with methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access.
   - **Key Points**: Private fields, public getter and setter methods.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - **Concept**: Hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality.
   - **Key Points**: Abstract classes, interfaces.

5. **Arrays:**
   - **Single-dimensional Arrays**: Storing and accessing data.
   - **Multi-dimensional Arrays**: Handling complex data structures.
   - **Key Points**: Declaration, initialization, and manipulation.

6. **Strings:**
   - **Concept**: Objects representing sequences of characters, with methods to perform operations.
   - **Key Points**: Methods like `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `trim()`, `replace()`, `concat()`, `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `split()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, `contains()`, `matches()`.

**Project Implementations:**

1. **[Contact Management System](src/Day2/ProjectA.java)**:
   - **Description**: A system to manage contact details using encapsulation.
   - **Key Features**: Adding, displaying contact details with validation for phone numbers and email addresses.

2. **[String Manipulation Tool](src/Day2/ProjectB.java)**:
   - **Description**: A tool to perform various string operations.
   - **Key Features**: Converting to uppercase, lowercase, finding length, checking prefixes and suffixes, replacing characters, splitting strings.

**Key Learnings:**
- **Inheritance**: Reusing code and establishing relationships between classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods performing different tasks based on the object.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data and providing controlled access.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.
- **Arrays**: Managing collections of data efficiently.
- **Strings**: Utilizing powerful string manipulation methods.
- **Project Practice**: Implementing projects to reinforce learning and understanding of the concepts.
