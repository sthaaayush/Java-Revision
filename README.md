### Java-Revision
**[Day 1: Java Learning Journey](/src/Day1)**

**Overview:**
Today, I focused on foundational Java concepts, including understanding the Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Virtual Machine (JVM). I also explored primitive data types, control flow statements, and loops.

**Topics Covered:**

1. **Java Basics:**
   - **JDK, JRE, and JVM**: Learned the differences and relationships between JDK, JRE, and JVM. 
   - **Primitive Data Types**: Covered different primitive data types, their sizes, ranges, and default values.

2. **Control Flow Statements:**
   - **`if-else` Statements**: Used to make decisions in the code.
   - **`switch` Statement**: Employed for multi-way branching.

3. **Loops:**
   - **`for` Loop**: Iterated over a range of values.
   - **`while` and `do-while` Loops**: Used for repeated execution of code blocks.

4. **Project Implementations:**
   - **Guess the Number Game**: A console application where the user guesses a random number.
   - **Simple Calculator**: A console application that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
   - **Student Grade Management System**: A console application to input grades, calculate the highest, lowest, and average grades.

**Key Learnings:**
- **Primitive Data Types**: Their properties and usage.
- **Control Flow**: Making decisions and branching in code.
- **Loops**: Repeating tasks and iteration.
- **Project Practice**: Implementing projects to reinforce learning and understanding of the concepts.
